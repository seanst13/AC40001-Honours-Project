>Block 5 in itself is similar to crossword based games such as scrabble. The game takes place on a 5×5 grid with the number five always starting in the centre cell.  The game functions by placing one or two pieces numbered between one and five onto grid while taking turns between players, however the total for the rows and columns of a connected tile must always be an odd number. This carries on until the grid is completely filled, or there are no possible moves remaining. The player who earns the most points at the end is the declared the winner.
